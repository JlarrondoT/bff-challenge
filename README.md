Challenge for Meli

get the service up and running!

in your terminal run:

```bash
npm install
```
to install dependencies

then run: 
```bash
npm run start
```
to get the project running.

once the server is up, you can use the health api to get the status, just make an http request to [your-local-ip]:[configured-port-default:3000]/health

to run tests, in your terminal run:
```bash
npm run test
```
